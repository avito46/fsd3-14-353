Not exactly. **`Content-Type` is not a function**, and it doesn't ask the user to store anything.

A better definition is:

> ## Content-Type

`Content-Type` is an HTTP response header that tells the browser what type or format of data is being sent by the server.

It is **not a function** and it does not ask the user to store a file.

### Example

```js
res.setHeader("Content-Type", "text/html")

#Server can send followinf types of data
1. html content
2. html files
3. json data
4. plain text
5. css
6. jss
7. file

## Server can set Header to send data
1. res.statusCode()
2. res.writeHead()

#request methods
1. get
2. post
3. put/patch
4. delete
